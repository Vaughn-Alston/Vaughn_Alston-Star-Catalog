          <p>
            Hi, I'm Vaughn a Computer Science student with a passion for merging technology and environmental awareness.
            I created this website to spotlight the effects of light pollution in South LA and help people find the rare spots where the stars still shine.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not coding, you’ll find me working out or spending time with my girlfriend, friends, and family.
            Being outdoors has always been a big part of my life, and it’s what inspired me to use my tech skills to raise awareness about the environment.
            In a world that’s constantly moving — whether we’re locked into screens or not — animals go extinct, plants disappear, and stars fade behind artificial light.
            This project is my way of encouraging others to slow down, look up, and care.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built this site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.
            I hope it not only helps people discover new places but also inspires them to protect the beauty of our night skies .
